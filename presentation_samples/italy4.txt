Italy has an important place in the international art and music scene.

Italy is the homeland of a number of great artists, including painters and sculptors. Some notable artists include Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael. The Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, is the most famous, most reproduced and most parodied painting of all time. 

Instrumental and vocal classical music is an iconic part of Italian culture. Italian innovation in musical scales, harmony, notation, and theatre enabled the development of opera in the late 16th century, and much of modern European classical music, such as the symphony and concerto.

Luciano Pavarotti, an Italian operatic tenor who also crossed over into popular music, was one of the most commercially successful tenors of all time.
