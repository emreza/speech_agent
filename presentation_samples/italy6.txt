Italian cuisine is one of the most popular in the world, with influences abroad. 

Italian cuisine is characterized by its extreme simplicity, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation.

Italian cuisine is also well known for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths and shapes. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names. Examples include spaghetti (thin rods), rigatoni (tubes or cylinders), and lasagna (sheets).

Cheese and wine are a major part of the cuisine. Italy produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Wine is commonly consumed in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it's extremely uncommon that meals be served with any other drink alcoholic or otherwise.
