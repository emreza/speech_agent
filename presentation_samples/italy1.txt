Located in Southern Europe, Italy consists of the boot-shaped Italian Peninsula and a number of islands.

The official language of Italy is Italian. Italy has numerous dialects spoken all over the country and some Italians cannot speak Italian at all. A number of minority languages (e.g. French and German) have co-official status alongside Italian in various parts of the country. In these parts, official documents are multi-lingual and traffic signs are also multi-lingual.

Italy has been ranked as the world's 25th most-developed country and its Quality-of-life Index was ranked in the world's top ten in 2005. Italy enjoys a very high standard of living and a high public education level.

Italy is home to the greatest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites (47) to date, and has broad cultural influence worldwide.
