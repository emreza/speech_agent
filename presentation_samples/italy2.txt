Italy has a long tradition in science and technology, dated back in the Roman era. 

By the first century AD, Rome had become the biggest and most advanced city in the world. Italy is the homeland of a number of notable scientific minds.

Galileo Galilei was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, and the observation and analysis of sunspots.

Leonardo da Vinci is famous for his contributions to a variety of fields including art, biology, and technology. While being renowned primarily as a painter, he also conceptualized a helicopter, a concentrated solar power, a calculator, among others.

The physicist Enrico Fermi, a Nobel Prize winner, was the leader of the team that built the first nuclear reactor and is also noted for the co-development of the quantum theory.
