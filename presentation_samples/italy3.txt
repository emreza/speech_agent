Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements.

Italy has a very broad and diverse architectural style, which cannot be simply classified by period, but also by region, due to Italy's division into several city-states until 1861. Italy possesses several of the finest works in Western architecture.

The Colosseum is the largest amphi-theater (i.e. open-air venue used for entertainment and performances) in the world. It is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions. It was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles, such as re-enactments of famous battles and dramas based on Classical mythology. The Colosseum is also depicted on the Italian version of the five-cent euro coin.

The Leaning Tower of Pisa is the freestanding bell tower of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its unintended tilt to one side. The tower's tilt began during construction, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure's weight.
